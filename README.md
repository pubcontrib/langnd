# langnd

> langnd is one programmer's dream programming language that focuses on
minimalism, consistency, and portability.

This project is the home of the langnd programming language. Both the design
and the implementation of the language are a work in progress.

    # set numbers a and b, put their sum into c, then print it
    $a = 300
    $b = 200
    $c = @add($a, $b)
    @write(@cast($c, "STRING"), 1)
